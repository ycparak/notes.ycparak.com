From Stripe’s wonderful blog. Uses Web Animations API. The trick is to duplicate the tab list, one in default styling, one with active styling, and use clip path to show the active indicator. This way, you can use any colors you want without relying on solutions that use mix-blend-mode. Make sure to mark the duplicate items with aria-hidden.

Visual Tools is a collection of Figma plugins for intuitively crafting beautiful interfaces. It's a collection of tools that lets you focus on hitting the nail rather than on how to hold the [hammer](https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/1000000000000000000/Hammer).

What started out as a small side project, has grown into a suite of design tools used by more than 300,000 creatives all over the world.

This past summer, I gave a lecture at a web conference and afterward got into a fascinating conversation with a young digital design student. It was fun to compare where we were in our careers. I had fifteen years of experience designing for web clients, she had one year, and yet some how, we were in the same situation: we enjoyed the work, but were utterly confused and overwhelmed by the rapidly increasing complexity of it all. What the hell happened? (That’s a rhetorical question, of course.)

It was a relief for both of us to mutually confess our frustration and confusion, and I began to wonder if this situation was something to laugh off or take seriously. Neither of us had an answer, but a bit of time and distance has shown me that we must do both. I’d like to extend that conversation today and attempt to capture my perspective on that confusion and what it costs us.

In 2005, Chris Zaldua was a college student at Wilfrid Laurier University in Waterloo, Ontario, when he discovered Superfuture. He had been searching for information on selvedge denim, the kind of jeans made from vintage looms that mostly existed in Japan. In North America, where the process of hunting for vintage selvedge denim was like crate digging at record stores, a subculture formed comprising peer-vetted aficionados who passed down shared knowledge (and with it taste) that accumulated and distributed across a loose, oral network that was only beginning to map itself online. Wearers took to cuffing their jeans at the ankle, revealing the inner selvedge weave like a cryptic insignia only recognizable to other initiates.

The first section Zaldua stumbled upon was dedicated to shopping and fashion, but nested within was a denim thread that was curiously teeming with more activity than anywhere else on the site. He described to me, “I had the feeling of excitement you get when you discover an entire world that you know nothing about, and you need to dive in.”

In 2022, Laurene Powell Jobs announced the launch of the Steve Jobs Archive. Our curated exhibits and publications draw on material from our private archival collection and reflect Steve’s deep respect for the past. Our programs recognize his relentless focus on the future by bringing his commitment to excellence and his epic sense of possibility to new generations.

I was very lucky. I had a father, named Paul, who was a pretty remarkable man. He never graduated from high school. He joined the Coast Guard in World War II and ferried troops around the world for General Patton, and I think he was always getting into trouble and getting busted down to Private. He was a machinist by trade and worked very hard and was kind of a genius with his hands.
