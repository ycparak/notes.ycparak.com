In an interview with Lovers Magazine, I was asked what advice I’d give to ambitious designers. The absurdity that they think I’m qualified to give advice aside, I figured I’d neatly sidestep the ego tripping question by writing it as advice to myself crouched as advice to others.

    You ask advice: ah, what a very human and very dangerous thing to do! For to give advice to a man who asks what to do with his life implies something very close to egomania. To presume to point a man to the right and ultimate goal — to point with a trembling finger in the RIGHT direction is something only a fool would take upon himself.

  <!-- <p>
    I am not a fool, but I respect your sincerity in asking my advice. I ask you though, in listening to what I say, to remember that all advice can only be a product of the man who gives it. What is truth to one may be disaster to another. I do not see life through your eyes, nor you through mine. If I were to attempt to give you specific advice, it would be too much like the blind leading the blind.

If you want to be a great designer, design more. Design more than anyone you know. Refine more, ideate more, tinker more. If you truly want to be a great designer, this won’t feel like work to you. That in itself will tell you you’re on the right path. Follow your curiosity and design things interesting to you. Then design them again. Then add different tweaks. Maybe change the typography, or the colours, or the spacing. Refine your skills and your taste. Build up a body of work on the shoulders of designers further ahead than you. Start to piece together what differentiates bad design, from good design, from great design.

If you’re just starting out, what you create will not be very good. Other designers, perhaps even civilians, will see it right away. Maybe they’ll tell you as much, or worse, they’ll just be indifferent. This killed me at the start, and still does. If you care about your work, it will. You just need time for your skills to catch up to your taste. Perhaps a week from now, or a month, or even a year, you’ll look back at the stuff you created and realise they were right. Your work did suck. That’s the odd thing about being a creator — to be a great one — you have to always keep improving. And when you do, you’ll always look back at your previous work and cringe. At least I think so, I haven’t reached the stage where I’m proud of my previous work.

Follow your curiosity. There are many designers in the world, each with their own tastes, methods and ideas, craft your own set by following your curiosity. Your work will be better for it. This manifests itself by doing work you find interesting. That’s easy to do when you’re working on your own projects, but at some point you’ll have to do work for others. If you’re a freelancer, aim to get to the point where you can pick the projects you work on. More commonly though, if you’re going to work for a company, be sure that the company’s mission resonates with you and perhaps more importantly, that they value design. Every company and CEO will claim they do, few in actuality do. Ask them what their designer to engineer ratio is. Ask them if they separate out frontend engineering from UI engineering from design. Ask them if they understand the differences between a product designer, brand designer or graphic designer. Those three questions will tell you enough. You’ll still have to do work you’re not that keen on, but on net, you’ll be working on things you find interesting in a company that values design.

Keep on the edge of new technology. In architecture it means keeping abreast of the latest materials and fabrication methods. Perhaps there’s some new material that lets you build structures 5x cheaper. That would be revolutionary! Just imagine the implications for something like low income housing. The same thing exists in our sphere of technology. Understand the devices you’re building for. Understand their strengths and limitations.
Should interface designers learn to code? My answer is an emphatic yes. That interaction you designed that relies on animating width? Turns out it’s too much of a hit on performance. Or the cool anchor based scrolling you got your developer to implement? It would work beautifully and performantly if only it was implemented using CSS scroll points rather than Javascript. Front-end developers are not designers. They have their own set of (growing) concerns, most of which have to do with client–server interaction, not CSS or UI interactions. If an architect has to rely on an engineer to tell them their building will have issues, they’ve failed. Similarly, if your design is to be implemented well, with a native-like experience, that’s on you.

If you ever feel like there’s no new inventions in UI design left to be made, just remember that modern GUI’s have only been around for ~3 decades. Architecture, print and industrial design have been around for centuries. There’ll continue to be new advancements in hardware and software that drive designers to rethink how to place pixels on an interface. Adjust with each advancement.
