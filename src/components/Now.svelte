<p>Working towards a beta release of <a target="blank" href="https://moonshotter.com">Moonshotter</a> while also growing it. Throwing up a site at <a href="https://designer.engineer">Designer.engineer</a> for the <a href="https://twitter.com/_designengineer">@_designengineer</a> twitter account. Its been cathartic to switch between both projects as a creative break.</p>
<p>Working on the two projects has made it easy for me to keep improving my craft but I’m reminded of a question in <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Talent-Identify-Energizers-Creatives-Winners/dp/1250275814">Talent</a> that I keep thinking about — “what do you do that’s anagolous to a pianist practicing scales?’’ Not sure I have a good answer to this, nor the time to consciously practice scales especially since I’m trying to create a symphony, but I’m thinking about it nonetheless.</p>
<p>Prioritising strength, fitness, sleep and diet. For a while now, I’ve slipped out of a good routine I had going. Not anymore, I’m back at it and feel better than I have in a long time. I’m lifting weights 3x a week (modified <a target="_blank" href="http://swoleateveryheight.blogspot.com/2014/07/the-gzcl-method-simplified_13.html">GZCL method</a>) and run ~7km twice a week.</p>
<p>I'm soon going to modify the running to incorporate a day where I do a <a href="https://www.topendsports.com/testing/tests/20mshuttle.htm" target="_blank">beep test</a>. One of my bucket list items is to learn and train Muay Thai in Thailand. So I like the idea of working towards getting a +13 beep test score as a goal before I can think of making that trip.</p>
<p>I’ve been on an economics kick lately, currently reading <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Good-Economics-Times-Abhijit-Banerjee/dp/1610399501">Good Economics for Hard Times</a>, will probably attempt to read <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Capital-in-the-Twenty-First-Century/dp/B00K33AFOK/ref=sr_1_1?crid=1T60Z12XQVKG0&keywords=capital&qid=1688272285&s=books&sprefix=capital%2Cstripbooks-intl-ship%2C528&sr=1-1">Capital</a> next if I can understand enough of it.</p>
