<p>The broad through line of my work is trying to design and build software that leaves a lasting impression. Currently I’m building Pinched.io, a network-based sourcing tool. It helps cool people and companies find their next hire, sales lead, or founder to invest in.</p>
<p>Prior to starting Pinched.io, I was a design engineer at Thinkst Canary, where I helped redesign &amp; rebuild the frontend console for a tool widely used by security teams in detecting network attackers. In university, I studied Computer Science after a brief stint as an architecture student.</p>
<p>More recently I’ve become deeply inspired at utilising web primitives in conjunction with advancements in hardware and software to build great applications. Particularly interesting to me are projects where design, engineering and product intersect in unique ways.</p>
