<p>The broad through line of my work is trying to design and build software that leaves a lasting impression. Currently I’m building Moonshotter, a sourcing tool reimagined for a world that exists with AI. More specifically, Moonshotter helps cool companies find and recruit world class talent.</p>
<p>Before making the jump to work on my own projects, I worked as a design engineer at Thinkst Canary, where I helped redesign and rebuild the frontend console for a tool widely used by security teams in detecting network attackers. In university, I studied Computer Science after a brief stint as an architecture student.</p>
<p>More recently I’ve become deeply inspired at utilising web primitives in conjunction with advancements in hardware and software to build native-like applications. Particularly interesting to me are projects where design, engineering and product intersect in unique ways.</p>
