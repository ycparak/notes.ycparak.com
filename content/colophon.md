This site is built with VueJS and NuxtJS. It uses the fantastic [Nuxt Content](https://content.nuxtjs.org/) module under the hood. Nuxt Content allows me to write in markdown, include Vue components in the markdown, and then query those markdown files in a MongoDB like way. I use SCSS as a CSS pre-processor. The site is hosted on Vercel. Initial wireframing was done in <inter-link href="figma">Figma</inter-link>.

I wanted to use a typeface that felt modern and legible at all screen sizes. I also wanted to play around with variable fonts. [Inter](https://rsms.me/inter/) designed by [Rasmus Andersson](https://rsms.me/) fit the bill beautifully.

The design and ux takes inspiration from a bunch of places:
- <inter-link href="andy-matuschaks-note-taking-system">Andy Matuschak's note taking sytem</inter-link>
- Emmad's [Blackout Poetry Generator](https://blackout-poetry-generator.glitch.me/)
