Is violence a separate entity which can be disassociated from a protest? Or are violent and non-violent actors co-mingled in a way that cannot be separated?

- A nonviolent protest provides the cover for those who loot and vandalise. At the same time, violent actions put an emphasis on the protests, which gives attention and a sense of urgency to end them quicker. And we know that <inter-link href="attention-is-the-best-asset-in-the-modern-economy"></inter-link>.
- Inspired by the fervour and growing movement, more protestors join in. This provides further cover for more looters and vandals.

- In essence, a sufficiently large protest will have a <inter-link href="flywheel-effect"></inter-link>, created in part, because of bad actors.
