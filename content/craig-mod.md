Craig Mod is a writer, photographer, designer, author and publisher. He was an early member of the original Flipboard team. His writing has deeply influenced the way I think about two things:
1. Technology and the [role it plays in my life](https://craigmod.com/essays/offscreen_interview/). 
    - <inter-link href='work-at-a-scale-that-resonates-with-you' space-before="false"></inter-link>
2. How software [should](https://craigmod.com/essays/fast_software/) [be](https://craigmod.com/essays/software_slump/) built.
