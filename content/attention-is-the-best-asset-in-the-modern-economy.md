title: Attention is the Most Important Asset Today
date: 2020-06-06
abstract: "My teenage cousin is obssessed with the number of Instagram followers she has. Almost to the point where I worry about her. But she's obssesed like a lot of other gen z'ers because she realises — whether consciously or not — that attention is the most important asset today. If no one's there to hear what you say, you don't exist."
