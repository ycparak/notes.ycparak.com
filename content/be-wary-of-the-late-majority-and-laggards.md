There's an oft overlooked consequence of passing <inter-link href="the-diffusion-of-innovation" space-after="true"></inter-link> tipping point. If you start a cause that reaches this milestone: 
1. Congratulations on becoming fabulously wealthy, i.e. <inter-link href="attention-is-the-best-asset-in-the-modern-economy"></inter-link>.
2. Be wary. Be wary, because every new person that now joins your cause didn't have the insight to initially believe in it nor seek it out. And some percentage of these people will join solely because everyone else is — it's these people you have to worry about.

The late majority of employees to join a company for example — won't necessarily be joining because they believe in the initial principles the company was founded on. They'll be joining for other reasons. Chief among them will be the prestige and CV trophy, of joining a company of that scale.

The late majority to join a protest for example, won't necessarily be protesting because they believe what you believe. They'll be doing so, because it has now become socially dangerous not too.
