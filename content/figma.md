It felt magical because until then it seemed crazy that you’d use the browser to do anything as GPU intensive as designing an interface. And what’s even crazier — in some instances the browser based Figma felt faster and lighter to use than the native desktop design tools of the time."

Figma is an interface design and collaboration tool. It came out for preview release in December 2015 after being in development for 3 years (<inter-link href="the-next-generation-of-good-software-may-require-long-development-cycles"></inter-link>). And since then has gone on to (probably) become the dominant design interface tool used by teams today.

Figma came out with a browser-first design tool that felt magical to use. It felt magical because until then it seemed crazy that you’d use the browser to do anything as GPU intensive as designing an interface. And what’s even crazier — in some instances the browser based Figma felt faster and lighter to use than the native desktop design tools of the time. Figma was able to do this because they took advantage of a large technological shift <inter-link href="webgl-and-webassembly-for-high-performant-gpu-intensive-applications"></inter-link>.

Figma is one of the few tools that feels amazing to use. Figma is <inter-link href="good-software"></inter-link>. Their technological advantage allows them to build other impressive things on top of their core design tool. Collaboration and multiplayer mode, are first class citizens and feel both frictionless and instantaneous. Their plugin ecosystem is rich and amazing at filling edge cases or levelling up specific parts of a design.
