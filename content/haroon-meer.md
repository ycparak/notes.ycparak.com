Haroon Meer is the founder of <inter-link href="canary">Thinkst Canary</inter-link>. This note is still a work in progress. There's a bunch of lessons I've learnt from working with Haroon that I'll get to adding at some point. Here's some ways he's influenced me or at least some lessons learnt working with him:
- <inter-link href="ruthlessly-eliminate-pages-from-your-software">Ruthlessly eliminate pages from your software</inter-link>
- <inter-link href="good-software-is-unconscious"></inter-link>
- Once you reach a certain scale, being a CEO means more than anything being a coach. Your job is to constantly be the bearer for reminding everyone what they're fighting for, why it's worth fighting for, and making sure that vision is table stakes.
