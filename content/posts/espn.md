title: Phil Coffman on ESPN
note: "This oral history by ESPN of the 2000 dunk contest and the rise of Vinsanity is well worth your time. I remember watching it on TV. The hype around Vince Carter was real. The man could flat-out jump and hearing the backstory of the dunks he performed was a joy to consume. Hard to believe heâ€™s still playing in the NBA to this day."
