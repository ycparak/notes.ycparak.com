title: Attention is the Most Important Asset Today
abstract: "There's a funny joke that keeps repeating itself on Twitter — would you rather have a Harvard degree or a large (> 20k) engaged Twitter following. Assuming that Twitter following has some purchasing power or will in the future, it's a hard choice. That seems crazy to say, 10 years ago it would have been obvious. Now, everyone knows the benefits of having a large following. You'd only need to convince 1% of that 20k into buying a $50 product to make $10k. If it's a recurring product, you've just setup a level of financial freedom most would dream of. But it's not only the monetary benefits that come with having a large following"

There's a funny joke that keeps repeating itself on Twitter — would you rather have a Harvard degree or a large (> 20k) engaged Twitter following.

Assuming that Twitter following has some purchasing power or will in the future, it's a hard choice. That seems crazy to say, 10 years ago it would have been obvious. Now, everyone knows the benefits of having a large following. You'd only need to convince 1% of that 20k into buying a $50 product to make $10k. If it's a recurring product, you've just setup a level of financial freedom most would dream of.

But it's not only the monetary benefits that come with having a large following...
