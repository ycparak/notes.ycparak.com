title: The next generation of great software may require a long initial development time
abstract: "Figma took 3 years to get to preview release. Superhuman took a similarly long period. Both companies were going after markets with deeply entrenched existing players. The next generation of software may also have to spend a long time in initial development. This has tension with the common wisdom of moving fast and getting to initial release as quickly as possible."
