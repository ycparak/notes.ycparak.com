[Thinkst Canary](https://canary.tools/) is an infosec company founded by <inter-link href="haroon-meer">Haroon Meer</inter-link>. The core thesis is that most companies find out way too late that they've been breached. Canary solves this by providing super simple, easy to deploy, honeypots, that require 0 overhead. The operative words being 'super simple', 'easy to deploy' and '0 overhead'.

It's an extreme example of <inter-link href="good-software-is-unconscious">unconscious software</inter-link>. People setup Canaries on their network in minutes, and can then proceed to forget about them. If you get an alert from one of your Canaries, that's when you know something bad is happening. I obviously have skin in the game, but I think that signal to noise ratio is immense.

Canary is interesting because it's an example of <inter-link href="product-led-growth-and-bottom-up-sales">product led growth and bottom-up sales</inter-link>. We have one sales person (maybe 2 now) and yet it's being used by the best of the best in Silicon Valley, some notable government organisations, and many of the Fortune 500. I joined Canary early in 2019, because it's hard to pass on doing work at that scale.
