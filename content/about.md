I'm a South African software engineer and designer working at Thinkst Applied Research. There, I work on <inter-link href="canary">Canary</inter-link> — one of the [most loved](https://canary.tools/love) security products around.

This site is a public collection of my notes. I built it after being deeply inspired by <inter-link href="andy-matuschak">Andy Matuschak</inter-link> and <inter-link href="andy-matuschaks-note-taking-system">his note taking system</inter-link>. Similar to Andy, if these notes seem confusing, controversial and/or half-baked, it's probably because I wrote them for myself. Unlike Andy, I do maintain a navigational list of <inter-link href="notes">all my notes</inter-link>. I also maintain collections of <inter-link href="aphorisms">aphorisms</inter-link> and <inter-link href="influences">influences</inter-link>. This site has a <inter-link href="colophon">colophon</inter-link>, and the code is open sourced [here](https://github.com/ycparak/ycparak).

If <inter-link href="stripe">Stripe</inter-link>’s goal is to increase the GDP of the internet — I'm interested in finding and researching the areas where GDP growth is arbitrageable, particularly by small indie teams. My other area of focus is in deeply trying to understand and craft <inter-link href="good-software">good software</inter-link>.

If the intersection of that venn diagram, `internet opportunity && software craftsmanship`, weirdly turns you on — be sure to subscribe to my email list.
