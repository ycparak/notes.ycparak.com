I'm a South African software developer and designer working at Thinkst Applied Research. There, I work on [Canary](https://canary.tools/) — one of the most loved security products around.

This site may seem a bit odd to you, hopefully in increasingly weird and wonderful ways. It's my attempt at what Cory Doctrow calls an outboard brain. It's also deeply, profoundly and heavily inspired by the work of Andy Matuschak and his note taking system.

If Stripe's goal is to increase the GDP of the internet — I'm interested in finding and researching the areas where GDP growth is arbitrageable by small indie teams. My other area of focus is in deeply trying to understand and craft great software.
