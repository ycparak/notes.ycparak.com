title: Ruthlessly eliminate pages from your software
abstract: "This site has only one page. Columns open next to one another. The idea of having only one page in an application is something Haroon Meer actively pushes for. When I joined Canary, I was adamant that spliting functionality into context specific pages was a good thing. I've since changed my mind on this completely. Every page adds more state that the user has to keep track of. They have to remember that x is located on y page. The other problem with seperate pages is it has switching costs. Those costs can take a user out of unconscious thought."

This site has only one page. Columns open next to one another. The idea of having only one _page_ in an application is something <inter-link href="haroon-meer">Haroon Meer</inter-link> actively pushes for. When I joined Canary, I was adamant that spliting functionality into context specific pages was a good thing. I've since changed my mind on this completely. Every page adds more state that the user has to keep track of. They have to remember that `x` is located on `y` page. The other problem with seperate pages is it has switching costs. Those costs can take a user out of unconscious thought (<inter-link href="good-software-is-unconscious">Good software is unconscious</inter-link>).
