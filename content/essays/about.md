abstract: "I'm a South African software engineer and designer working at Thinkst Applied Research. There, I work on Canary — one of the most loved security products around. If Stripe's goal is to increase the GDP of the internet — I'm interested in finding and researching the areas where GDP growth is arbitrageable by small indie teams. My other area of focus is in deeply trying to understand and craft great software."

I'm a South African software engineer and designer working at Thinkst Applied Research. There, I work on <inter-link href="canary">Canary</inter-link> — one of the most loved security products around.

This site is a public <inter-link href="notes">collection of my notes</inter-link>. I built it after being deeply inspired by <inter-link href="andy-matuschaks-note-taking-system">Andy Matuschak and his note taking system</inter-link>. If these notes seem confusing, controversial and/or half-baked, it's probably because I wrote them for myself. I also maintain collections on <inter-link href="aphorisms">interesting aphorisms</inter-link> I've come across, and <inter-link href="influences">people and things that have influenced me</inter-link>. This site has a <inter-link href="colophon">colophon</inter-link>, and the code is open sourced [here](https://github.com/ycparak/ycparak.com).

If Stripe’s goal is to increase the GDP of the internet — I'm interested in finding and researching the areas where GDP growth is arbitrageable, particularly by small indie teams. My other area of focus is in deeply trying to understand and craft <inter-link href="good-software">good software</inter-link>.

If the intersection of that venn diagram, `internet opportunity && software craftsmanship`, weirdly turns you on — be sure to subscribe to my email list (substack). Alas, I'm not on Facebook, Instagram or LinkedIn but you can find me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/ycparak) (DM's open).
