title: WebGL
abstract: "WebGL is a rasterisation engine implemented as a Javascript API. It's designed to compute 2D/3D graphics very fast in a Web browser. It does this by tapping into the processing power of the GPU being used. I don't yet understand WebAssembly well enough to give a better description than that. Even that description may be slightly wrong."

WebGL is a rasterisation engine implemented as a Javascript API. It's designed to compute 2D/3D graphics very fast in a Web browser. It does this by tapping into the processing power of the GPU being used.

I don't yet understand WebAssembly well enough to give a better description than that. Even that description may be slightly wrong.
