This note is still a work in progress. It takes time, if you hadn't documented it already, to list out your influences. So if it seems bare it's only because I haven't yet listed everything. Regardless, I think it's important to recognise that we stand on the shoulders of giants. In no particular order:
- <inter-link href="canary">Canary</inter-link>
- <inter-link href="haroon-meer">Haroon Meer</inter-link>
- <inter-link href="andy-matuschaks-note-taking-system">Andy Matuschak's note taking system</inter-link>
