title: WebAssembly
abstract: "WebAssembly is a binary format for machine code that was specifically designed with browsers in mind. Apps compiled to WebAssembly aim to execute as fast as native apps. This means WebAssembly has the potential to change the way software is written on the web. I don't yet understand it well enough to give a better description than that. Even that description may be slightly wrong."

I don't yet understand WebAssembly well enough to give a better description than that. Even that description may be slightly wrong.
