The first time I came across Andy's notes, I recall having a wide grin on my face. Interacting with it felt like a lightning bolt moment. I immedietely grokked: 
1. How having a system like his could help sift out [insights](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/z6cFzJWgj9vZpnrQsjrZ8yCNREzCTgyFeVZTb).
2. The elegance of his user experience in facilitating (1).
3. The importance of [evergreen note taking as it contributes to knowledge work](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/z3SjnvsB5aR2ddsycyXofbYR7fCxo7RmKW2be).


Up until that point, I wasn't much of a note taker. I typically used notes for remembering ephemeral tasks. I had known about the renaissance happening in note taking and [tools for thought](https://numinous.productions/ttft/). But I hadn't paid it much due, partly because of intellectual laziness and partly because it didn't feel important enough. That's funny because <inter-link href="transformational-things-start-out-by-looking-like-toys">transformational things often start out looking like toys</inter-link>.

Using his system also felt like a UX breakthrough. And I don't mean that light heartedly. Having the ability to open notes side by side sounds trivial. But that, combined with backlinks and dense interlinking opens up so many possibilities. Internal or external company knowledge bases are an easy example. A better Wikipedia that facilitates even more rabit hole digging is another. 

It's also worth noting that — point & click, copy & paste or even pull to refresh — would have all sounded trivial at one point. Now they're staples of everyday life. I think this could become one too.
