Is violence a separate entity which can be disassociated from a protest? Or are violent and non-violent actors co-mingled in a way that cannot be separated?

A nonviolent protest seemingly provides the cover for those who loot and vandalize. At the same time, violent actions put an emphasis on the protests, which gives attention and a sense of urgency to end them quicker. Inspired by the fervour and growing movement, more protestors join in. This provides further cover for more looters and vandals.

This seems obviously related to the [laggard phenomenon](/be-wary-of-the-laggards), but may actually work in favour of the initial goal.
