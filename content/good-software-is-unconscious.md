Good software exists to serve a purpose (<inter-link href="good-software-is-purposeful" space-before="false"></inter-link>). And serves it so singularly, it blends and becomes hidden amongst the other trivialities of our busy lives. Like a watch, it becomes one with its master, only noticed when broken or when absent. Only then do you feel it. The emptiness of not having it.

Google is an example of software that feels like this. When you open it, you don’t get the feeling that you’re opening a _web application_. It even seems crazy to think that Google is a web application. Like conscious vs unconscious thought, most applications feel conscious, Google feels unconscious.

There’s other examples of software that’s so good it feels hidden. But like any good thing, there’s very few. Figma is another example. Figma won’t feel unconscious to a new user. It takes time to learn it. But a proficient Figma designer doesn’t even think about the tool, the tool is unconscious, it’s the design that becomes the centre stage for conscious thought.

For software to be unconscious, it has to work **all of the time**. If the software fails me once, the next time I open it, I worry it will fail me again. And worrying means I’m no longer operating in unconscious thought. <inter-link href="good-software-is-reliable"></inter-link>.

For software to be unconscious, it also has to be fast. Software that has latency issues makes me worry that it has other more important issues. And worrying means I’m no longer operating in unconscious thought. <inter-link href="good-software-is-fast"></inter-link>.
