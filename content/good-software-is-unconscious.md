title: Good software is unconscious
abstract: Google is an example of software that feels like this. When you open it, you don’t get the feeling that you’re opening a web application. It even seems crazy to think that Google is a web application. Like conscious vs unconscious thought, most applications feel conscious, Google feels unconscious."

Good software exists to serve a purpose. And serves it so singularly that it blends and becomes hidden behind the user's end goal. Like a good watch, it becomes one with its master, only noticed when broken or when absent.

Google is an easy example of software that used to feel like this. They've lost it now, but when you opened that tab and hit their homepage, you didn't get the feeling that you were using a _web application_. It even seems crazy to think that Google was a web application. Like conscious vs unconscious thought, most applications felt conscious, Google felt unconscious.

There’s other examples of software that’s so good it feels hidden. But like any good thing, there’s very few. I’m biased but I think <inter-link href="canary">Canary</inter-link> is an (extreme) example of this. <inter-link href="figma">Figma</inter-link> is another example. Figma won’t feel unconscious to a new user. It takes time to learn it. But a proficient Figma designer doesn’t even think about the tool, the tool is unconscious, it’s the user's design that becomes the center stage for conscious thought.

For software to be unconscious, it has to work **all of the time**. If the software fails me once, the next time I open it, I worry it will fail me again. [It also has to be fast](https://craigmod.com/essays/fast_software/). Software that has latency issues makes me worry that it has other more important issues. And worrying means I’m no longer operating in unconscious thought.
