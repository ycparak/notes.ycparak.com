To me, native technology means hidden technology. It exists to serve a purpose. And serves it so singularly, it blends and becomes hidden amongst the other trivialiities of our busy lives. Like a watch, it becomes one with its master, only when it's absent, do you notice it. You feel it. The emptiness of not having it.
