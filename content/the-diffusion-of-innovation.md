abstract: "A nonviolent protest provides the cover for those who would loot and vandalise. At the same time, violent actions put an emphasis on the protests, which give a sense of urgency to end them quicker. 

This brings in more nonviolent protestors inspired by the fervour and growing movement. Which in turn provides cover for more looters and vandals. In essence, a sufficiently large protest will have a flywheel effect, created in part, because of bad actors."
excerpt: 'Non-violent protestors may need bad actors to draw fervour to their cause, in turn drawing in more protestors.'

Is violence a separate entity which can be disassociated from a protest? Or are violent and non-violent actors co-mingled in a way that cannot be separated?

A nonviolent protest provides the cover for those who would loot and vandalise. At the same time, violent actions put an emphasis on the protests, which give a sense of urgency to end them quicker. 

This brings in more nonviolent protestors inspired by the fervour and growing movement. Which in turn provides cover for more looters and vandals. In essence, a sufficiently large protest will have a flywheel effect, created in part, because of bad actors.
