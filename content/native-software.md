Native software means hidden software. It exists to serve a purpose. And serves it so singularly, it blends and becomes hidden amongst the other trivialiities of our busy lives. Like a watch, it becomes one with its master, only noticed when absent. Only then do you feel it. The emptiness of not having it.
