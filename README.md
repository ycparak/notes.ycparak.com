# PKMS

Note taking system inspired by [Andy Matuschakâ€™s notes](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/About_these_notes), built with Vue and Nuxt.js. As an interface paradigm, horizontal panning seems to me to encourage ephemeral rabbit hole consumption.

## Use

```bash
# install dependencies
$ npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:3000
$ npm run dev

# build for production and launch server
$ npm run build
$ npm run start

# generate static project
$ npm run generate
```

For detailed explanation on how things work, check out [Nuxt.js docs](https://nuxtjs.org).
